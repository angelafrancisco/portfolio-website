## Project Requirements
1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
1. Hosted on Netlify or GitHub Pages.
1. Commits to GitHub every day.
1. A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
1. Have the following pages:
	- home (greeting page)
	- bio (your background)
	- resume (past work experience)
	- projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build)
	- links (links to your github, linkedin, and other sites you find interesting)
		- optionally, instead of making this a separate page, you can make these links appear as part of a navigation section that appears on all pages
1. Use JS/JQuery to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens).
1. Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).
